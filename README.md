## Getting Started: Grocery List App 

- Build a single-screen grocery list app using the Flutter SDK.
- The app should allow users to add, remove, and edit items in the grocery list.
- Implement the BLoC pattern for managing state. 
- Implement persistence of the grocery list state on disk. When the mobile app is reloaded, it should restore the last saved state of the grocery list.
The use of shared preferences is recommended for storing and retrieving the grocery list data.
